# Visualizing WesMaps

This repository contains scripts to scrape, clean, and visualize [WesMaps](https://iasext.wesleyan.edu/regprod/!wesmaps_page.html), Wesleyan University's online course catalog.
For convenience, this repository contains the raw data as well.

You can see the visualization and read more about this project on the [QAC Projects website](http://qacprojects.wesleyan.edu/visualizations/visualizing-wesmaps.html).
